# LanguageEndangerment
Custom R code for ordinal probit regression with correction for autocorrelation

The repository is for Appendix A in "Global predictors of language endangerment and the future of the worldâ€™s linguistic diversity"

data.Rdata and Codes.R include all the data and R codes used in all the analyses reported in the paper.

Codes.R has seperate blocks for each analysis. 

The analyses mainly use functions in R package "ordinalNet" for ordinal probit regression.

Custom R function 'autoord' and its related functions modify functions in "orginalNet" to correct for autocorrelation in ordinal probit regression.

Details of these functions are in Codes.R.
